## How start undestaing helm
Let's start by [Creating your first helm template](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/#a-starter-chart). 
After that as suggested in the link we will delete al template related things and star from scratch

## Your first templated varialbe

As seen on the link above lets create a *_helpers.tpl* but instead of a *configmap* I will go with *cronjob.yaml* (that works just as well).
Once created let's take the first four lines of the deployment.yaml crated by default this contain metadata an weâ€™ll use it to setup the name form the Chart.yaml
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: {{ include "my-first-application.fullname" . }}
```
In this case we named the variable as **app.name** at *_helpers.tpl* so we will have to go form **my-first-application.fullname** to app name.

To check that everything works got your repository root directory and run the following command
> helm template [whatever_name] -f .\values.yaml

If all checks out you should se tha name devined at Chart.yaml as your metadata name.

```
//Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: my-first-application
```
